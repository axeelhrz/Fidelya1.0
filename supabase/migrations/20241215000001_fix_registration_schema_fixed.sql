-- Fixed version of fix_registration_schema migration
-- This replaces the problematic 20241215000000_fix_registration_schema.sql

-- All functionality is now handled by the unified schema
-- This migration is kept for compatibility but does nothing
-- as the users table and registration system are already created

SELECT 'Registration schema fix completed - using unified schema' as status;
